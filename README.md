Fully functioning app created using Create React App. 

The app uses React Router, also libraries  from Axios, Formik (with Yup validation) and Swiper.

It connects to a REST API to fetch  initial content and images for the app, and  to post the contact form.  Form validation is handled on the front end, and error handling is included when communicating with the API.  Postman was used in the development and testing of the API connection and error handling.

The design is fully responsive, and renders appropriately on large screens as well as mobile.
